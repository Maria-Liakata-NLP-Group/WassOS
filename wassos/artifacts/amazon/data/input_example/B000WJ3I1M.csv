B000WJ3I1M	I have this cupholder mounted on the handle bars of my 2001 Harley Davidson and it works great for any type of liquid , my only suggestion is something with a screw on lid because of the vibration .	5.0	reviews_electronics_5	PRP VBP DT NN VBD IN DT JJ NNS IN PRP$ CD NNP NNP CC PRP VBZ JJ IN DT NN IN NN , PRP$ JJ NN VBZ NN IN DT NN IN NN IN IN DT NN .

B000WJ3I1M	I use my ATV for plowing my driveway . I also have a coffee addiction . The RAM Mount works perfectly on my ATV to allow me to keep a warm coffee cup near by on those cold mornings .
