B0000WKYU4	Manfrotto makes the best monopods and tripods on the market . Solid and sturdy . I use mine for added stability shooting wildlife in the field . Easily handles the weight of my Canon 6D and Sigma 150-500mm lens .	5.0	reviews_electronics_5	NNP VBZ DT JJS NNS CC NNS IN DT NN . NNP CC JJ . PRP VBP PRP IN VBN NN VBG NN IN DT NN .

B0000WKYU4	Took this on a cruise instead of a tripod . As long as you have anything you can get a 3rd point from , you actually have a tripod . Put a ball head on it and you have a very decent shooting point .	5.0	reviews_electronics_5	RB DT IN DT NN RB IN DT NN . RB RB IN PRP VBP NN PRP MD VB DT JJ NN IN , PRP RB VBP DT NN .

B0000WKYU4	Holds together well , as long as you don 't use it as a walking stick . It is constructed well , a little on the heavy side , but if it weren 't it wouldn 't hold up well . Looking forward to using it more this summer .	4.0	reviews_electronics_5	NNS RB RB , RB RB IN PRP VBP `` NN NN PRP IN DT NN NN .

B0000WKYU4	This is a rugged monopod and definitely does what it 's intended to do ... I purchased the 486RC2 compact Ballhead for this and a 488RC2 Ballhead for my tripod so I could take the camera off of one and connect instantly to the other without delay ... I would recommend this to my friends ... One of my co-workers is getting this one too ..	5.0	reviews_electronics_5	DT VBZ DT JJ NN CC RB VBZ WP PRP `` VBZ VBN TO VB : PRP VBD DT CD NN NNP IN DT CC DT NNP NNP IN PRP$ NN IN PRP MD VB DT NN IN IN CD CC VB RB TO DT JJ IN NN : PRP MD VB DT TO PRP$ NNS : CD IN PRP$ NNS VBZ VBG DT CD RB . .
B0000WKYU4	This monopod is built like a tank , so much so that I probably should have gotten one a little smaller and lighter . I use this with the Manfrotto 322RC2 Joystick and it is a solid combo . If you need some gear to hold a heavy camera / long lens or to add structural support to your house , this is the monopod for you .	4.0	reviews_electronics_5	DT NN VBZ VBN IN DT NN , RB JJ IN IN PRP RB MD VB VBN CD DT JJ JJR CC JJR .
