    It performs the following operations:
        1. splits data-units by reviews. I.e. each data-unit has one review.
        3. creates dummy SUMMARY_CATEGORY, and CATEGORY not to break the later
           logic in the dev. interface.
        3. creates SUMMARY_GROUP_ID that stores the id of the business that
           summary.csv belongs to. (Later used in the dev. interface)
        4. wraps each summary.csv by a list as there is one summary.csv per business

    Produces 'invalid' data-chunks as the number of summaries will be different
    from the number of input reviews.
